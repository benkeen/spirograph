# Spirograph

This little script provides a UI for generating spirographs. Nothing terribly special, I just wanted an excuse to play
around with some different frameworks and get a sense of how they fit together. If you're looking at the code and find
something un-idiomatic to that framework, let me know!

## Demo

Backbone - [http://benkeen.github.io/spirograph/](http://benkeen.github.io/spirograph/backbone/)
AngularJS - [http://benkeen.github.io/spirograph/](http://benkeen.github.io/spirograph/angular/) (incomplete!)
